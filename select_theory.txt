1. Python’s select() function is a direct interface to the underlying operating system implementation.
   It monitors sockets, open files, and pipes (anything with a fileno() method that  returns a valid file descriptor) 
   until they become readable or writable or a communication error occurs. 
   
   select() makes it easier to monitor multiple connections at the same time, and is more efficient than writing a polling loop in Python using socket timeouts, 
   because the monitoring happens in the operating system network layer, instead of the interpreter.


2. Note: Using Python’s file objects with select() works for Unix, but is not supported under Windows.
